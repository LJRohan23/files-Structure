# files-Structure
TITLE : Implemeting the FILE structure.
Rohan Yogi : 111503061
This is a project aimed to implement functions pertaining to the FILE structure, using only the raw , low-level functions : open(), read(), write() and lseek().

Each to-be-implemented f-type function makes use of these functions to initialize, access or change the values of the data memebers of the 'files' structure. The task was to create this project in around 1000 lines.
Several functions have been implemented successfully, however the time complexity may pose a minor issue.
